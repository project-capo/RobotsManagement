##How to run an application

There is no standalone version (*.apk*) for this project. 
If you want to run it on your device, you frist need to *set up your workspace*
and then compile it on your own.



##How to set up a workspace

In order to set up a workspace you first need to download ADT ([Android Development Tools](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html)). Once you integrate your IDE with ADT you will need two aditional dependencies (imported as separate projects - if using Eclipse):
- [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html) - download via Android site
- [Google Play Services](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html)

Please also note, that the application uses Android SDK v14.
